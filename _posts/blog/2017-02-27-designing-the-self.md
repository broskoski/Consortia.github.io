Since I’ve decided to start writing for the company blog more often, I went with Medium as the platform for the writing and distribution of the articles. It kind of seems like the obvious choice in this day and age.[1]

However, I wanted to have the latest posts appear on our site as well without any of us needing to update and redeploy the site each time a new article is published because we want to expose the content directly to our visitors who wouldn’t necessarily be inclined to visit the blog specifically.

As it turns out this is not so easy to do, unless you are a developer and know how to work with APIs.
Being a designer and a basic front-ender, I figured there has to be a way to do this with the almighty jQuery. After some googling I’ve stumbled upon several hints that made me think it might be possible, and it involves getting JSON-formatted content from Medium, and parsing it into your HTML with jQuery.
