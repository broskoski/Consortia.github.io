A year-long initiative created by Consortia at Columbia University in partnership with Audi of America, which developed a series of experimental concepts and programming to identify new paradigms of motion and mobility in design. Consortia coordinated three graduate architecture studios, created a yearlong digital content series, installed an exhibition of student work, and organized a public events series.
